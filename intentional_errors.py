# Error list
'''
# With working for loop, I run into "IndentationError: expected an indented block"
while working with loop, we need to indent provide colon(:) after conditiion and indent 1 tab for the black statements.
 Thats how Python compiler understnds this is a block statement, otherwise it will give about error.

 Solution : To fix this issue, I indented block statement and run the code again. it displayed desired output.
